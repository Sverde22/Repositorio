## AWOLNATION: 'This isn't a comeback - it's a reunion'
---
AWOLNATION star Aaron Bruno opens up about coming back from mild obscurity with a new album, and a new lease on life. And how a UK tour looks within it all.

It's been a while for Aaron Bruno. The frontman and face of AWOLNATION hasn't really seen the light of day for some time, and there are a few reasons for it.

First of all, when the band released their last record, Angel Miners & the Lightning Riders, in 2020, the world shut down soon thereafter. Since then, he's been trying to start a family, and has since had twin boys. On top of that, he released an album of cover songs - "just for fun" - My Echo, My Shadow, My Covers, and Me in 2022.

Speaking exclusively to "Express" from within his home sauna, a couple of weeks ahead of the announcement, Bruno seemed at peace. Even an interview promoting a new album felt like a break for him with two almost-newborn twin boys in his home. But, looking forward, he has even more work to do.

However exciting this new album is, it was once a sombre idea, as Bruno wanted it to be his final album - ever. "When I was writing a lot of this record [I did it] knowing that I was going to become a father," Bruno explained. "And with the world upside down... I was also thinking: this may be the last AWOL record. And so I kind of went into the writing as if to say farewell to the listener."

(BPM) AWOLNATION has announced headline dates for 'The Phantom Five Tour' with special guest Bryce Fox, which will kick off Thursday, March 27 at House of Blues in San Diego and run through May. The tour will hit many major cities throughout North America.

The tour announcement comes on the heels of AWOLNATION's newest album 'The Phantom Five', released last month. Composed of ten tracks, Aaron Bruno aka AWOLNATION says he "wrote this album with the intention that it could possibly be the final AWOLNATION album". It includes singles "Panoramic View", "Jump Sit Stand March", "I Am Happy" feat. Del The Funky Homosapien and "Barbarian".

'The Phantom Five' is a collection of ten songs that highlights every different impulse and urge Bruno has learned to master with AWOLNATION in a cohesive, anthemic pastiche of modern music. It functions almost as a "greatest hits" album, in the sense that it offers something for everyone who has followed the band's arc in its celebrated, shape-shifting way. 'The Phantom Five' is concerned with trying to find one's way to happiness in a bizarrely upside-down time.

"I wrote this album with the intention that it could possibly be the final AWOLNATION album," continues Bruno. "I wanted the challenge and inspiration of that idea. I'm not sure if it will actually be the last album, but I wanted to create that narrative to push myself with it and put everything I have into these songs."

## Awolnation and Emily Amrstrong
---
Awolnation — aka Aaron Bruno — has announced a new album titled The Phantom Five. Ahead of its August 30th release comes the single and video “Jump Sit Stand March” featuring Dead Sara singer Emily Armstrong.

The song “Jump Sit Stand March” finds Bruno and Armstrong trading verses, with Armstrong in full scream mode — a sharp contrast to the tune’s melodic chorus. An accompanying music video depicts the two singers in a diner, as they end up slow-dancing on top of the counter.

“We’ve played a few shows with Dead Sara over the years and I’ve always been a fan of Emily’s voice,” stated Bruno in a press release. “She is a vocal superstar. She ripped it on this track, and it’s really fun to have the male and female vocals together, especially in the chorus where the textures are so nice.”
