## AWOLNATION: 'This isn't a comeback - it's a reunion'
---
AWOLNATION star Aaron Bruno opens up about coming back from mild obscurity with a new album, and a new lease on life. And how a UK tour looks within it all.

It's been a while for Aaron Bruno. The frontman and face of AWOLNATION hasn't really seen the light of day for some time, and there are a few reasons for it.

First of all, when the band released their last record, Angel Miners & the Lightning Riders, in 2020, the world shut down soon thereafter. Since then, he's been trying to start a family, and has since had twin boys. On top of that, he released an album of cover songs - "just for fun" - My Echo, My Shadow, My Covers, and Me in 2022.

Speaking exclusively to "Express" from within his home sauna, a couple of weeks ahead of the announcement, Bruno seemed at peace. Even an interview promoting a new album felt like a break for him with two almost-newborn twin boys in his home. But, looking forward, he has even more work to do.

However exciting this new album is, it was once a sombre idea, as Bruno wanted it to be his final album - ever. "When I was writing a lot of this record [I did it] knowing that I was going to become a father," Bruno explained. "And with the world upside down... I was also thinking: this may be the last AWOL record. And so I kind of went into the writing as if to say farewell to the listener."
