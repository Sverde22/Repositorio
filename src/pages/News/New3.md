## Awolnation and Emily Amrstrong
---
Awolnation — aka Aaron Bruno — has announced a new album titled The Phantom Five. Ahead of its August 30th release comes the single and video “Jump Sit Stand March” featuring Dead Sara singer Emily Armstrong.

The song “Jump Sit Stand March” finds Bruno and Armstrong trading verses, with Armstrong in full scream mode — a sharp contrast to the tune’s melodic chorus. An accompanying music video depicts the two singers in a diner, as they end up slow-dancing on top of the counter.

“We’ve played a few shows with Dead Sara over the years and I’ve always been a fan of Emily’s voice,” stated Bruno in a press release. “She is a vocal superstar. She ripped it on this track, and it’s really fun to have the male and female vocals together, especially in the chorus where the textures are so nice.”
